# Async components
Here are components necessary to make async loading working; these components are for async functions but this this folder is not here to store all components loaded via that method. Only the tools necessary to make it happen.

By default this folder contains pure functions (components). If closely-related container (class component) needs to live close-by, it'll be in the /containers folder.
