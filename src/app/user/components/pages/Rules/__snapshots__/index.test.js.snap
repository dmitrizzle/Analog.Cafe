                    Anyone who submits text, format, and images for publication on Analog.Cafe, using the above-mentioned Composer tool and submission page will be referred to here as an Author. Format is a layout of the submission work (links, highlights, quotes, how the images arranged, etc.) “Work” and “submission” are used interchangeably, meaning the same thing: uploading the text, format, and images to Analog.Cafe owned and/or rented servers. Editor(s) are the people or person who have provided edits to the submission and have the right and capacity to publish the work on Analog.Cafe website.
          </p>
          <p>
                    Authors retain the complete copyright of their work. By submitting their work they give Analog.Cafe the right to exhibit it in accordance to the terms listed below.

                     By submitting text, format, and images work Authors give Analog.Cafe full, non-exclusive permission to exhibit it online on this website and any other location representing this website (such as social accounts, other websites offline printed and display medium etc). Authors’ work may be included (same general function as “retweeting” on Twitter or “sharing” on Facebook or any other social network) within other Authors’ submissions with a link to the first Author’s profile on Analog.Cafe when clicked on an image and in the title of the post. Authors are giving Analog.Cafe and the Authors of Analog.Cafe the right to use their work in such manner (Analog.Cafe will make reasonable effort to ensure that all of such actions are respectful and in good faith, up to discretion of Analog.Cafe editors). Authors are also granting Analog.Cafe Editors the permission to modify the submissions (cropping, colour and quality adjustments as well as copy editing and visual decorations). Authors are free to request an immediate withdrawal of the work at any time via email (see

We will comply as soon as possible or within two weeks of request; images which are used within other posts or are “suggested” images will take longer to remove (up to 30 days), since we’ll be forced to make arrangements that would satisfy all the Authors and Editors who have used that material. Analog.Cafe also reserves the right to remove Authors’ work at any time at Editors’ discretion.

                        Anyone who submits text, format, and images for publication on Analog.Cafe, using the above-mentioned Composer tool and submission page will be referred to here as an Author. Format is a layout of the submission work (links, highlights, quotes, how the images arranged, etc.) “Work” and “submission” are used interchangeably, meaning the same thing: uploading the text, format, and images to Analog.Cafe owned and/or rented servers. Editor(s) are the people or person who have provided edits to the submission and have the right and capacity to publish the work on Analog.Cafe website.

                        Authors retain the complete copyright of their work. By submitting their work they give Analog.Cafe the right to exhibit it in accordance to the terms listed below.

                        </strong>
                         By submitting text, format, and images work Authors give Analog.Cafe full, non-exclusive permission to exhibit it online on this website and any other location representing this website (such as social accounts, other websites offline printed and display medium etc). Authors’ work may be included (same general function as “retweeting” on Twitter or “sharing” on Facebook or any other social network) within other Authors’ submissions with a link to the first Author’s profile on Analog.Cafe when clicked on an image and in the title of the post. Authors are giving Analog.Cafe and the Authors of Analog.Cafe the right to use their work in such manner (Analog.Cafe will make reasonable effort to ensure that all of such actions are respectful and in good faith, up to discretion of Analog.Cafe editors). Authors are also granting Analog.Cafe Editors the permission to modify the submissions (cropping, colour and quality adjustments as well as copy editing and visual decorations). Authors are free to request an immediate withdrawal of the work at any time via email (see

We will comply as soon as possible or within two weeks of request; images which are used within other posts or are “suggested” images will take longer to remove (up to 30 days), since we’ll be forced to make arrangements that would satisfy all the Authors and Editors who have used that material. Analog.Cafe also reserves the right to remove Authors’ work at any time at Editors’ discretion.

                         Authors’ work is being exhibited on a non-exclusive basis, unless otherwise specified. This means that you are free to continue submitting it to any other gallery or website that you wish.

                         If an Author chooses to place watermarks on images, their aesthetics will be considered by Analog.Cafe Editor. Meaning that tasteful, well-designed (this is up to Analog.Cafe Editor’s discretion) watermarks may be acceptable; badly-designed, obstructive (this is up to Analog.Cafe Editor’s discretion) watermarks might diminish Authors’ works’ chances to be accepted.

                         There are no submission fees and no monetary compensation to the person submitting unless otherwise specified. Analog.Cafe editors select and publish submissions that they feel are a good fit – and reserve the right to decline any and all submissions. Analog.Cafe gives no guarantee or promise of any kind that a submission will be accepted, kept, or published.

                        All copy-editing and touch-up work is done at Analog.Cafe Editors’ discretion. Analog.Cafe may or may not accept Authors’ edit requests; all edits are done for the benefit of a good overall presentation of the whole magazine, rather than just one piece. Analog.Cafe staff has limited time and resources, please keep that in mind when making requests.

                        Submissions which have not been accepted are subject to being deleted from our servers within a month of such decision. This is a manual action and isn’t a rule or a guarantee.

Format is a layout of the submission work (links, highlights, quotes, how the images arranged, etc.) “Work” and “submission” are used interchangeably, meaning the same thing: uploading the text, format, and images to Analog.Cafe owned and/or rented servers.

                 By submitting text, format, and images work Authors give Analog.Cafe full, non-exclusive permission to exhibit it online on this website and any other location representing this website (such as social accounts, other websites offline printed and display medium etc). Authors’ work may be included (same general function as “retweeting” on Twitter or “sharing” on Facebook or any other social network) within other Authors’ submissions with a link to the first Author’s profile on Analog.Cafe when clicked on an image and in the title of the post. Authors are giving Analog.Cafe and the Authors of Analog.Cafe the right to use their work in such manner (Analog.Cafe will make reasonable effort to ensure that all of such actions are respectful and in good faith, up to discretion of Analog.Cafe editors). Authors are also granting Analog.Cafe Editors the permission to modify the submissions (cropping, colour and quality adjustments as well as copy editing and visual decorations). Authors are free to request an immediate withdrawal of the work at any time via email (see

We will comply as soon as possible or within two weeks of request; images which are used within other posts or are “suggested” images will take longer to remove (up to 30 days), since we’ll be forced to make arrangements that would satisfy all the Authors and Editors who have used that material. Analog.Cafe also reserves the right to remove Authors’ work at any time at Editors’ discretion.

                 If an Author chooses to place watermarks on images, their aesthetics will be considered by Analog.Cafe Editor. Meaning that tasteful, well-designed (this is up to Analog.Cafe Editor’s discretion) watermarks may be acceptable; badly-designed, obstructive (this is up to Analog.Cafe Editor’s discretion) watermarks might diminish Authors’ works’ chances to be accepted.

                 There are no submission fees and no monetary compensation to the person submitting unless otherwise specified.

Analog.Cafe gives no guarantee or promise of any kind that a submission will be accepted, kept, or published.

                All copy-editing and touch-up work is done at Analog.Cafe Editors’ discretion. Analog.Cafe may or may not accept Authors’ edit requests; all edits are done for the benefit of a good overall presentation of the whole magazine, rather than just one piece. Analog.Cafe staff has limited time and resources, please keep that in mind when making requests.

                Submissions which have not been accepted are subject to being deleted from our servers within a month of such decision. This is a manual action and isn’t a rule or a guarantee.

                Spam and any submissions deemed unacceptible or inappropriate are subject to immediate deletion and the Author’s account is a subject to suspension or banning.
