# Analog.Cafe
## An open-source project for the "Remarkable Film Photography Blog"
> You are free to use any code in this repository for your personal or business projects.
> But please do not clone the design and content.

### Built with:
* [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react)
    * [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
    * [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
    * (and more)

### Why it's awesome:
* Images can be re-published by contributing authors, natively. Those images share all the functions and features of original image, while giving appropriate credit to the author. Without having to save, re-upload or embed stuff.
* "Features Library" that helps managing the above images for admins and contributors.
* Separate View app (built with React) and Model/Controller JSON API coupled with a database to manage content.
* All the expected user management controls, post scheduling, editing and reviews.
